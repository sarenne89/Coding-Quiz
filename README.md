Week 6 Challenge - Web APIs

## Description

In this weeks challenge we have been tasked with creating a coding quiz using Javascript and what we've learned so far about web APIs. 
There will be a a start button, a timer, and a series of questions with buttons for answers. 
Each time the right answer is clicked, the next question will appear. When the wrong answer is clicked, time will be removed from the timer. 
At the end of the quiz or when the timer reaches zero, the player will be taken to another page where they can input their name along with their high score, and this will be stored in local storage.
